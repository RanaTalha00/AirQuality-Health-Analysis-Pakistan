## 📘 Overview
This project explores the relationship between **air quality (PM2.5)** and **public health** across major cities in **Pakistan (2019–2020)**.  
It uses **RStudio** for data wrangling and correlation analysis, and **Power BI** for data visualization.  
The goal is to derive insights that can guide **evidence-based environmental and health policy**.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze air pollution trends across Pakistani cities.  
- Correlate **PM2.5 levels** with **respiratory cases**.  
- Evaluate the **impact of air quality policies** over time.  
- Present findings through interactive dashboards.
